                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am the third child of six born to Carole Lee Carter. The first of three boys. I am a child of the 60s and 70s. My place of birth was Elmondorf AFB in Anchorage, Alaska and I grew up in Jamaica, Queens. I am a New Yorker through and through, even though I have lived in San Diego County for the past 29 years. I played football and basketball well but not great. I am married with children and love every second being a family guy.

                <p>
                    I love to cook, and if you ask me to I will cook what ever you can imagine. I can get lost in my backyard smoking the meat du jour. <br>
                    I've coached youth basketball from grade school to high school.<br>
                    I love to fish
